Here at Skyblock University, we believe each and every person deserves to feel comfortable in our guild. However, this does not mean that we allow individuals to bully or treat others poorly in our guilds and server. Unfortunately, our moderation team cannot be everywhere at once, so we need to rely on our Helpers to tell us when someone has taken an action that has disturbed them or otherwise made them uncomfortable.
"""

Here’s a few examples of potential rule breaking that’s reportable:
```Begging
Talking about drugs
Talking about sexually related things
Spamming chat with caps, or fast messages with little in it
Promoting rule breaking or leading people to break rules
Hacking```
"""
end = """
This list is not exhaustive, but should give you an idea of some of the things that we don’t allow. You can find a full list of our rules in rules

If you find someone doing these actions in game you can report them to our moderation team by opening a “report a user” ticket in get-help. Please be sure to include screenshots of everything you are reporting.

Our lack of knowledge of these situations happening may turn into people thinking we tolerate bad behavior. This is not our intention or what we wish to show new members. The more people report, the more aware we are of people who make everyone else unhappy, the faster we can remove excessively disruptive people and make our guilds and server more comfortable for everyone. You will be our front line in making our server safe for both current and new members.

Bobby531 recently joined the guild and is asking for a Hyperion for free, then saying they’re just kidding right afterwards. They have repeated this behavior a few times in the past.

It’s never fun to be nagged by guild members for free things. We have “No Begging” in our rules and believe everyone should know that they can be in our guild without 10 people harassing them, asking for free things. Regardless if someone says “just kidding” right after, it’s still annoying to have to deal with on a regular basis, and we don’t want to have to force our members ignore these issues or /ignore add the beggar. Handling them right away by reporting them is the best and fastest way to get someone to stop doing an undesirable behavior.

Georgina32 and Bobby555 have been talking about drugs for a few minutes, both of them are just simply naming drugs one after another. This started because Bobby555 said he needed more drugs for his dungeon runs(referring to Potions).

Because Mojang’s ToS states the game is for ages 10 and above, we don’t allow talk of illicit substances or likewise, due to the player base being so young. These actions would warrant a report, even if Georgina32 and Bobby555 have already stopped talking about drugs. You will need to take and submit screenshots with your report.

The sole purpose of our server and guilds are to help new and mid-game players learn how to play skyblock.
